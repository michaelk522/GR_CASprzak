# GR CASprzak
GR_CASprzak is an extension of CASprzak whose goal is to automate many of the very long computations found in GR/Tensor Calc

Hello, and welcome to GR_CAS. When I was learning GR, I reached a point where I needed to calculate 256-term Christoffel Connections and Curvature Tensors and I didn't have a Mathematica license to do it the normal way. So instead I wrote this as an extension of a Computer Algebra System I am working on.

More information on the original CASprzak project can be found at: https://github.com/EasyKayzey/CASprzak.

## Functionality
- Defining a `Space` or Geometry with which you are working in.
    - Defined with a set of variables and a metric
- Calculating the Christoffel Connection
- Calculating the Riemann Curvature Tensor
- Calculating the Ricci Tensor
- Calculating the Ricci Scalar
- Calculating the Einstein Tensor
- Calculating the line element
- Calculating the volume element

## Running
- Open this project in a decent Java IDE and code scripts in there
    - All code relating to this specific project can be found in `src\GR`
    - Look at the example code if you need help getting started
